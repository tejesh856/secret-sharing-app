<p id="description">The project is a web application that allows users to post and view anonymous secrets. It includes features such as user authentication posting secrets and viewing a feed of posted secrets. The front end is built using React and the back end includes endpoints for user authentication and secret posting. The application uses React Router for navigation and includes modals for user login and signup. The secrets are fetched from and posted to a backend server via API calls. The project emphasizes user privacy and engagement with a simple and intuitive interface.</p>
